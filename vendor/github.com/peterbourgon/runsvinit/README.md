# runsvinit

If you have a Docker container that's a collection of runit-supervised daemons,
this process is suitable for use as the ENTRYPOINT.
See [the example](https://github.com/peterbourgon/runsvinit/tree/master/example).

**Why not just exec runsvdir?**

`docker stop` issues SIGTERM (or, in a future version of Docker, perhaps another custom signal)
but if runsvdir receives a signal,
it doesn't wait for its supervised processes to exit before returning.
If you don't care about graceful shutdown of your daemons, no problem, you don't need this tool.

**Why not wrap runsvdir in a simple shell script?**

This works great:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

sv_stop() {
	for s in $(ls -d /etc/service/*)
	do
		/sbin/sv stop $s
	done
}

trap "sv_stop; exit" SIGTERM
/sbin/runsvdir /etc/service &
wait
```

...except it doesn't [reap orphaned child processes](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/)
and is therefore unsuitable for being PID 1.

**Why not use my_init from [phusion/baseimage-docker](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)?**

That works great â€” if you're willing to add python3 to your Docker images :)

**So this is just a stripped-down my_init in Go?**

Basically, yes.
